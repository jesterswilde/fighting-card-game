//NOTES


Game board should change as people get more and more damaged. 

(evaluate next time you play) Glowing effect could be punched up. 

Clear up cards (anatomy of the card isn't clear immediately) 

Poise bar isn't clear immediately as to it's purpose

Focus vs Telegraph, differences not immediately obvious.  Consider how to make that more apparent

Bloodied needs a tooltip to explain what bloodied means
