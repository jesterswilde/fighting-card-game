When you have an option (like forceful) it shifts the stat block up. 

For some screen sizes, the game doesn't show up in one view. 

Generic cards might not be showing up in decks. 

Ground grab still has lock mechanic

Say how many cards you have total at the bottom, near save. So they don't have to scroll to find that info. 

Thrill Seeker wants to describe large telegraphs (big effect and mulitple requirements) and challenge the opponent to fight me on them. "Change one of these axis next turn or face the consequences." 

Weaken Opportunist or increase reqs. 

Unify tag capitlization 

When you reflex, you should be told what card you reflexed into if there are any choices to be made.

Reflexing into panic is blank, should say 'Panic' or 'Flail'

Styles should have more gap cards (1 or 2)

Message deck size at the bottom where it says update.

Needs tutorial. 

It is not clear that 'deck size' is max size. 

Look into unselecting card bug. (During deck creation)

Sometimes decks don't show up, and then you can't play because deck is undefined. 


//NOTES


Game board should change as people get more and more damaged. 

(evaluate next time you play) Glowing effect could be punched up. 

Clear up cards (anatomy of the card isn't clear immediately) 

Poise bar isn't clear immediately as to it's purpose

Focus vs Telegraph, differences not immediately obvious.  Consider how to make that more apparent

Bloodied needs a tooltip to explain what bloodied means
