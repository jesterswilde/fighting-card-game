Deck builder page needs a back button

Maybe still an issue? - Custom decks not showing up sometimes in deck choice. 

Update landing page

When you reflex, you should be told what card you reflexed into if there are any choices to be made.

Reflexing into panic is blank, should say 'Panic' or 'Flail'

Styles should have more gap cards (1 or 2)

Message deck size at the bottom where it says update. 

When a new deck is made, it should go to the deck builder page of that newly made deck. 
//NOTES


Game board should change as people get more and more damaged. 

(evaluate next time you play) Glowing effect could be punched up. 

Clear up cards (anatomy of the card isn't clear immediately) 

Poise bar isn't clear immediately as to it's purpose

Focus vs Telegraph, differences not immediately obvious.  Consider how to make that more apparent

Bloodied needs a tooltip to explain what bloodied means
