When you reflex, you should be told what card you reflexed into if there are any choices to be made

On the board, when the card is in queue-card form, hover tooltips don't work.

Work on consolidating the state chunk. 

Some indication that it's the opponent's turn would be good.

break up ui to top / bottom

Switch motion / standing names to just show the name of the current state

Damage got confused with block. Consider icon for block or better spacing? 

How can you make the second player feel better? 

Predict should be stronger, mess with heavy prediction cards. 

Blood in the water needs another prone card (maybe block and gain focus)

Sort card effect order. Probably a thing done on update. Maybe a script

Make 2 decks by next week, add 2 or 3 cards to Stone Skin and Blood in the Water

Consider seeing how many cards are in the opponents hand, if we do, maybe cripple cards should be face up. Would feel good.
