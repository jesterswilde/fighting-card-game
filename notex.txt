Poise should be a more central and active mechanic

Reflex on opponents turn doesn't show up as the proper color on the board

If you choose not to use forceful, it still shows up in the events modal

Inertia may need to be lowered to 4 and 4

When you reflex, you should be told what card you reflexed into if there are any choices to be made

You should not gain poise passively that will get you into anticipation

Update documentation to reflect poise and forceful
