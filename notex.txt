Poise should be a more central and active mechanic

If you choose not to use forceful, it still shows up in the events modal

Inertia may need to be lowered to 4 and 4

When you reflex, you should be told what card you reflexed into if there are any choices to be made

On the board, when the card is in queue-card form, hover tooltips don't work.

A button to view the events after a card was played would be good. 

Work on consolidating the state chunk. 

If reflxed into, telegraph doesn't get the opponent to react

If there are many events, each event gets really squished

Some indication that it's the opponent's turn would be good.
