When you reflex, you should be told what card you reflexed into if there are any choices to be made.

How can you make the second player feel better? 

Blood in the water needs another prone card (maybe block and gain focus)

Sort card effect order. Probably a thing done on update. Maybe a script

Consider seeing how many cards are in the opponents hand, if we do, maybe cripple cards should be face up. Would feel good.

Prediction display needs to be updated.

Prediction picking needs to be updated
