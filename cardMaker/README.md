## Possible Mechanics: 

`Objective Card` - Hidden card that sits outside of the queue, when it's state requirements are met, it is reveled and does it's thing.

`Cripple Cards` - These cards are put into your opponents deck, they do nothing, hinder when played, or hinder when drawn. Could match any state or be somethign like "Cripple Leg" Which has the requirement of moving.
`Buffed Cards` - Similar idea to cripple cards. These are cards that upgrade every time you play them, like kidney jab. 

`Predict` - I guess a state change that will be on the next card my opponent plays, if correct: do something.
`Telegraph` - Telegraph declares a state, if that state getse achieved while the threshold card is on the queue, get effeect. 
`Delay` - When this card is the last card in the queue, have extra effects.
`State Focus` - Declares a state, while in this state, 

`Reflex` - Play the first card that can be played from your deck

`Block X`- Damage Reduction X while on queue
`Shield X` - Prevents the next X damage while on queue 
(Either maybe mitigated when offbalanced)
